Complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI) and transient delirium during early hospital stay. Multidisciplinary management with input from Cardiology, Nephrology, and Psychiatry. Functional decline addressed with physiotherapy referral at discharge.\n\nConnections:\nPeripheral IV cannula inserted on admission for hydration and medication administration. No central line or catheter used. Site maintained over left forearm, clean and dry throughout. IV fluids administered cautiously due to renal status. Cannula removed today after completion of IV medications.\n\nMedications:\nInitiated on low-dose dual antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin and Clopidogrel) and Bisoprolol, titrated as per renal function and heart rate. No anticoagulation started due to elevated fall risk and recent delirium. Nephrology adjusted all medications based on creatinine trend. Creatinine peaked on day 2 and gradually improved with hydration and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents. Patient returned to baseline mentation. Discharged with a renal-safe medication regimen, follow-up labs planned. Family counseled extensively.\n\nSystem-Based Assessment:\n\nCardiac:\nPresented with typical ischemic chest pain. ECG showed ischemic changes and troponin was positive. Managed conservatively with DAPT and low-dose beta blocker. Echo revealed moderate systolic dysfunction with EF 40%. No arrhythmias noted. No PCI done due to renal status and stable hemodynamics. Chest pain resolved by day 2. Mobilizing slowly. Discharged on Aspirin, Clopidogrel, and Bisoprolol. Advised on activity limitation and follow-up in cardiology OPD. Cardiac rehabilitation referral initiated.\n\nRenal:\nCreatinine elevated on admission. Nephrology consulted. AKI likely due to dehydration and underlying vascular disease. IV hydration optimized. Renally adjusted medications continued. No need for dialysis. Renal function improved over admission course. Discharged with plan for repeat labs in 3 days. Patient and family educated on hydration, avoiding nephrotoxic drugs, and monitoring.\n\nNeurological/Cognitive:\nMild baseline dementia per family. Developed acute delirium on day 1 with fluctuating attention and confusion. No focal deficits. Psychiatry reviewed and attributed to metabolic causes (AKI, infection ruled out). Mentation improved with rehydration, sleep hygiene, and family presence. Now oriented to person and place. No further episodes noted.\n\nRespiratory:\nNo dyspnea or oxygen requirement. Chest clear throughout stay. SpO₂ maintained on room air. Lungs clear on auscultation.\n\nGastrointestinal:\nOral intake resumed fully by day 4. No nausea, vomiting, or abdominal symptoms. Appetite good. Bowel habits regular.\n\nUrinary:\nVoiding spontaneously. No retention, dysuria, or hematuria. No catheter placed. Renal function monitored closely. Input/output balanced.\n\nSkin & IV Site:\nSkin intact. No pressure injuries despite reduced mobility in early days. IV site clean, no signs of infection or bruising.\n\nMusculoskeletal:\nInitial functional decline noted due to deconditioning and delirium. Now mobilizing with walker. Referred to physiotherapy and rehab services. Family advised on fall precautions and home modifications.\n\nMental Health:\nMild baseline dementia; now back to baseline status. No mood disturbance noted. Family support strong. Psychiatry cleared patient for discharge with advice for outpatient follow-up only if symptoms recur.\n\nDischarge:\nDischarged in stable condition after NSTEMI with complications of AKI and delirium. On Aspirin, Clopidogrel, and Bisoprolol with renal-adjusted dosing. Family educated on cardiac care, fluid management, cognitive safety, and medication compliance. Follow-ups arranged with Cardiology, Nephrology, and Rehabilitation Services. Discharged ambulatory with walker and caregiver assistance.\n"

Physio consulted early during stay for passive ROM and positioning. No new contractures noted. Family advised on turning, splints, and gentle limb movements to preserve function.\n\nMental Health:\nAdvanced dementia. No behavioral outbursts. Comfort maintained with scheduled care and medication. Family supported emotionally and given caregiver resources.\n\nDischarge:\nDischarged in stable condition with improved sacral wound. Dressing to continue daily at home using alginate and sterile saline. Family trained and confident in wound care procedures. Pressure injury prevention protocols reinforced. Continue high-protein, calorie-dense nutrition with Ensure twice daily. Community nursing referral made for weekly wound monitoring. Follow-up with geriatrics and wound care in 1 week.
